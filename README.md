# Project Title: Climate Change in the Philippines through the Years

## Introduction

Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. The social and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation even bleaker. Progress in many areas, including time spent on unpaid care and domestic work, decision-making regarding sexual and reproductive health, and gender-responsive budgeting, is falling behind. 
Women’s health services, already poorly funded, have faced major disruptions. Violence against women remains endemic. And despite women’s leadership in responding to COVID-19, they still trail men in securing the decision-making positions they deserve. Commitment and bold action are needed to accelerate progress, including through the promotion of laws, policies, budgets and institutions that advance gender equality. Greater investment in gender statistics is vital, since less than half of the data required to monitor Goal 5 are currently available.
Gender equality in the Philippines has been a longstanding issue for many years. Despite progress being made, there is still much work to be done in order to achieve true gender equality. Women continue to face discrimination and inequality when it comes to access of education, employment opportunities, healthcare services and political representation amongst other areas of life.
The Philippines remains the best performing country in Asia in terms of gender parity although it slid down two notches in the Global Gender Gap Report of the World Economic Forum. In a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 represents optimal gender parity, the country scored 0.783, a slight slip from the 2022 score of 0.784. This means that the Philippines still has a 21.7% gender gap to close.

To summarize, this analysis focuses on the four (4) and five (5) SDGs, which are gender and educational opportunities are so strongly connected, particularly when it comes to access constraints for girls globally.  The goal of this research is to track developments in fair gender equality in all domains.

## Problem Statement

	As a part of the National Strategy for gender equality, a Multi-sectoral Joint Program1 was implemented (2008-2012) for fighting against gender-based violence through the empowerment of women and girls. In this context, the demand for gender based violence and time use data had been expressed by all stakeholders involved in this program and by other users. 

	There was a lack of information on gender based violence, the prevalence of the phenomenon breakdown by different forms, places and perpetrators profiles and their relationship with the victims. Thus, the set-up of a database of indicators on gender based violence is necessary for monitoring and assessing policies and programs aiming to fight violence against women and girls.

	Concerning data on time use, Morocco conducted in 1997 a survey focusing on women TUS. It aimed only to measure the economic and social contribution of women in society. Therefore, there was a lack of sex-disaggregated data that could measure domestic production and highlight gender inequalities in terms of time allocation patterns, participation in all forms of paid and unpaid work, work-family balance, investment of time in education and health; welfare and quality of life, decision making and task sharing within the household and the couple. 

	As a consequence, there was neither available data nor deep analysis of gender statistics in these two areas that could better reveal population groups where gender inequality is likely to be pronounced and violence is prevalent. This hindered the opportunity to develop effective programs and efficient policies targeting women empowerment and gender equality and aiming to fight against gender based violence.

## Significance of the Proposed Project

	Gender equality is a basic human right and a necessary condition for the elimination of poverty and attainment of national social and economic development. The principle of basic human rights calls for equal civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for all individuals. In the Philippines and around the world, there is growing recognition that development and poverty reduction cannot be achieved without equal access by all groups to decision-making, planning, political participation, education, and productive resources.

This research will be useful for the following purposes:

**The Students.** For those students who will be need a information that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Gender Equality

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about Gender Equality in Philippines through the years. They can use the data gathered for the project in their coursework. 

**The Government Officials.** For specific government officials who will be need a information  that they may use for their future project/s related to Gender Equality.

**The Future Researchers.** For the researchers to provide background knowledge about Gender Equality in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions

## Methods:

On this topic, many several investigations, assessments, and research initiatives have been carried out, and statistical information has been gathered. Despite several severe obstacles, gender equality is a subject that is still relevant in the Philippines today and offers the possibility to provide more empirical evidence and understanding on this study. After thorough analysis, conducting empirical research is suitable to focus on observable phenomena and increase the credibility of our findings. This focuses on doing an analysis of information to interpret patterns and meanings in the data collected and provide conclusions.

## Expected Output:
The goal of this project is to identify, investigate and analyze the issues that have a substantial impact on gender equality in any form. To gain a deeper understanding, the researcher will do extensive in-depth research and analysis. If the researchers’ findings are proven and there is a connection between the variables, and also if those findings are also getting worse, they can be used to raise awareness to reduce the factors that can contribute to gender inequality. It can also help for future research in developing a sufficient strategic plan. The government can also adapt and learn from the other nations that have effectively developed a strategy plan to address gender inequality. They can also advocate for a campaign and develop a program that can assist in resolving these challenges, especially among the younger generation.
